Furthermore, it is the only blockchain-based, GPU enhanced graph database in the world.  What cyber lacks in practicality, it makes up for tenfold in the team's realisitic assessment of the current state of human affairs, and offers some novel solutions for that.  Furthermore, cyber is at present capable of acting as a type of chain-linked storage system, for any front end application in Cosmos.  It is our opinion at Notional that cyber's concepts warrant a very serious look.  List: \n * GPU Accelerated Graph Database \n * Novel, branded, and tightly integrated block explorer \n * Team willing to say what everyone is thinking and no one is saying \n * Highly unique creative work, and in our opinion, likely to spawn additional highly creative work as the number of cyberlinks grows, and the network evolves \n\n ",
